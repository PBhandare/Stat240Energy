# Energy Performance and Analysis in the United States
### Stat 240 Intro to Data Modeling Final Project

Project Repository For Energy Consumption, Emissions and Analysis

This final project aims to gain insights and draw conclusions about energy usage, consumption, and byproduct emissions based on actual performance compared against previous year's projected performance.

Data has primarily been obtained through:
* https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/tables_ref.php (Energy Outlook for multiple projection time series)
* https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=2-AEO2020&sourcekey=0 (Consumption for individual years)
* https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=17-AEO2020&cases=ref2020&sourcekey=0 (Emissions for individual years)
